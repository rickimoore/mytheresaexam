# Getting Started with My Theresa

In response to the code challenge given by MyTheresa. 
This React App implements the TMBD Movie API to list upcoming, popular and the best
tv shows. To run the app clone this repo on your local.

### `git clone https://github.com/rickimoore/mytheresaexam.git`

Using terminal, enter the project folder and install the npm packages.
I was confused by `The codebase should be handcrafted, without using any boilerplate or third-party library`.
I didn't know if that included `create-react-app` or `react-redux` or any of the packages listed under the react
documentation. I considered those 1st party or 2nd party max. If that was a problem, sorry for not understanding.

Install the packages:

### `npm install`

Start the server by running:

### `npm start`

From here you can visit the site on your local host

### `http://localhost:3000/`


# Thanks for your time
## Respectfully, Ricki.
